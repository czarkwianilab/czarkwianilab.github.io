Our lab uses the amazing axolotl as a model to understand the biology of gravisensation. All species large enough to be affected by the constant pull of the force of gravity have evolved ways to sense it and orient themselves with respect to it. In humans and other tetrapods, our sense of gravity relies on tiny, biomineralized crystals called otoconia in specialized chambers in our inner ear. When these calcium carbonate crystals degrade or dislocate from the inner ear compartments, they can cause a variety of balance disorders including the most common type of vertigo (BPPV). Axolotls not only have highly conserved inner ear structure but also show the fantasic ability to regenerate these crystals if removed. Understanding how the axolotl can regenerate these structures and restore its correct sense of balanace on a molecular, cellular, structural and organismal level is the main goal of the Czarkwiani Lab.
