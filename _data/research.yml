 - title: Biomineralization of otoconia in axolotl development and regeneration
   description: Using biomaterial approaches we will study the inorganic phase of the otoconia in the axolotl. SEM and microCT imaging will be used to characterise the appearance of otoconial crystals. Spectroscopy techniques such as FT-IR will be used to determine their biophysical and biochemical properties such as calcium carbonate polymorph state.
